# Global-Trade-and-GDP-Correlation-Study
I created this project to investigate how international trade affects economic growth across countries using actual data from Kaggle. The study found a strong positive correlation (r = 0.62) between trade openness and GDP growth, indicating that export-driven economies outperform import-heavy ones.
